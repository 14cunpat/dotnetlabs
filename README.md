# .NET Labs -- Show Me the Tips and Tricks and Code

## This repository is archived. Please visit my organization account [https://github.com/dotnet-labs](https://github.com/dotnet-labs) for dotnet labs

I initially set up this mono repo to include all my code for topics related to .NET. However, as I write more and more articles, this repository becomes bigger and bigger, thus hard to navigate around.

Now I have created an organization account @dotnet-labs, which will be used for the same purposes as this repo. The main drawback is that GitHub doesn't support users to follow an organization account. Therefore, if you want to get newest updates (e.g., new repositories), you may want to follow me in GitHub, or in Medium.

Thank you.
